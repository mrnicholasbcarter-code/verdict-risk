## Is your feature request related to a problem?
<!-- A clear and concise description of what the problem is. -->


## Describe the solution you'd like
<!-- A clear and concise description of what you want to happen. -->


## Describe alternatives you've considered
<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->


## Mathematical / Risk Engine Considerations
<!-- Critical for risk engine features -->
<!-- Does this involve: -->
- [ ] New risk metrics or evaluators
- [ ] Floating-point precision requirements
- [ ] Performance constraints (hot-path latency and allocations)
- [ ] IEEE 754 compliance requirements
- [ ] Decimal precision for financial calculations
- [ ] State machine transitions

If yes, please detail the mathematical specification:


## Additional context
